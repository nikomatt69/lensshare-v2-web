13:39:36.294  Skipping build
                  → Skipping rebuild of an already fully passed/accepted build
13:39:36.295  ℹ Skipping rebuild of an already fully passed/accepted build
              A build for the same commit as the last build on the branch is considered a rebuild.
              If the last build is passed or accepted, the rebuild is skipped because it shouldn't change anything.
              You can override this using the --force-rebuild flag.
